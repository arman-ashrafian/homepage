I made this to get familiar with Vue JS. They are four main components; clock, stocks, calender, and journal. The cool part is the calender and journals. When I click a date on the calender a textarea pops up and I can write a journal. When I hit save it will create a text file with the date as the name and save it to Google Drive. 

## Todo
- remove google login link and just redirect to the the google login if the user trys accesing journal without being logged in.
- figure out the best naming scheme for files
- add weather component
